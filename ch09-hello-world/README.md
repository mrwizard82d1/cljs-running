# hello-world

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

I had tried to execute the code snippets from chapter 9 of
*ClojureScript: Up and Running*; however, I ran into issues with the
CLASSPATH. The function `clojure.main()` needed to be available;
however, I could not find it with a "quick" search.

Because my goal was to implement the other chapters using Visual
Studio tools, I decided to abandon this effort for now.
